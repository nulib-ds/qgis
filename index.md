### **Demo Data**
Our data we'll use today comes from here:
> [NHGIS State Boundaries](https://data2.nhgis.org/main)
> 
> [Boston Census Tracts](https://data.boston.gov/group/geospatial)
> 
> [Boston Buildings via QuickOSM Plug-In](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features)

<br>
  <br>
    <br>
      <br>
      
### **During the Demo**
We will attempt to answer the following questions:
> What % of buildings are at potential risk for flooding? 
> 
> What % of buildings are at-risk for flooding within a 20-meter buffer? 
> 
> Which Census tracts will experience the greatest risk of flooding damage to 	buildings?
