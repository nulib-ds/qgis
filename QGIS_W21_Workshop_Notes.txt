QGIS Workshop | Fall Quarter 2021 


 >>>_ What are we working on today?
	_ This workshop aims to familiarize yourself with the open-source QGIS software. The demostration today will focus on climate change, specifically rising sea-levels in Boston, Massettchusetts. We will try to answer three questions throughout this demo: 
	1. What % of buildings are at potential risk for flooding? 
	2. What % of buildings are at-risk for flooding within a 20-meter buffer? 
	3. Which Census tracts will experience the greatest risk of flooding damage to 	buildings? <<<

_ Let's go to the actual wesbite first before anything: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#
	_Version 3.16 Hannover
		_ Downloaded standalone installer (not lastest-release installer, which is less stable. You want long-term repository instead of latest release)

_ Basics
	_ Tool Bar (Navigation, Save, Add Data, Search Toolbox, Plug-ins)
	_ Data Frame/Map Extent
	_ Projection Button
	_ Panels (Layers + Browser)
	_ Toolbars

_ Basemaps 
	_ There are two ways to add basemaps in QGIS; either by XYZ Tiles or the QuickMapServices plug-in. A type of static imagery data. 
		_ Add-in different basemaps using data hosted on GitHub
				_ https://github.com/klakar/QGIS_resources/blob/master/collections/Geosupportsystem/python/qgis_basemaps.py

	_ So, let's use the ESRI Gray (light)

_ Download data
	_ What's in here?
	
_ Add US State Data (from NHGIS)
	_ Zoom
	_ What to do if you lose your layer
	_ Attribute table - what's this?
	_ Filter on variables/fields and obeservations "NAME" = 'Massachusetts'
	_ Layer styling - change to cream color

_ Add boston_buildings.shp
	_ Change to 'categorical' 

_ Add sea_level_rise_36.shp
	_ Change to transparent navy blue hue

_ Select by location
	_ Make sure toolbar is enabled (View > Toolbars > Selection)
	_ Where buildings intersect with sea_level_rise
	_ Open attribute table
	_ ANSWER 1: (713/3494)*100 = 20.4% of buildings are at risk for flooding by 2070

_ Create 20-meter buffer
	_ Select by location
	_ Open attribute table
	_ Answer 2: (898/3494)*100 = 25.7% of buildings are at risk for flooding with a 20-meter shoreline buffer by 2070

_ Export selected features as new feature layer
	_ At_risk_buildings.shp

SAVE MAP here

_ Add Tracts.shp
	_ Open attribute table
	_ Go to https://data.boston.gov/dataset/climate-ready-boston-social-vulnerability 
	_ Choose one of the variables that are interesting to participants

_ Using Population column, make choropleth map
	_ Change classification methodology
	_ Change classes
	_ Change color

_ Spatial Join using "Join attributes by location (summary)"
	_ Input layer = Census Tracts intersects at_risk_buildings.shp
	_ Fields to summarise = building
	_ Summaries to calculate = count
	_ Create labels on how many buildings are at risk
	_ Make choropleth map

_ Add hospitals.csv 
	_ Data Management button or drop-down menu (> Layer)
	_ SVG marker > hospitals

SAVE MAP here 

_ Create layout
	_ Layout Manager vs New Print Layout
	_ Add Legend, North Arrow, Scale, Title
	_ Lengend tip: if you can't delete an legend item, uncheck the 'Auto update' box
	_ Title: Pulitzer's Longbill Proposed Conservatory 
	_ Export as PNG
