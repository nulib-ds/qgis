# Introduction to QGIS workshop
This workshop was made using the [P2PU Course-in-a-box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/) template. We host our workshop materials through GitHub, a free and open-source software hosting platform. 

This workshop presents a brief history of GIS and its applications, followed by a demonstration using QGIS, which you can download [here](https://qgis.org/en/site/).
