title: Data Types and Formats
---
<html>
  
<h4>Data types</h4> are attributes that specify the type of data an object can hold.</html>

<br>

> GIS uses three main data types:<br>
> 1) **Vector**<br>
> 2) **Raster** <br>
> 3) **Tabular**

<br>

<html><h4>Data formats</h4> are specific or preferred file extensions for sharing, re-use, and preserving data. </html>

<br>

> **Vector data** includes formats like *shapefiles*. Shapefiles are GIS-specific data formats used in both proprietary and open-source software.

<br>

> **Raster data** stores information in a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value.

For today's workshop, we'll only be using vector data, as raster data tends to be larger and slower to work with. 

<br>

> **Tabular data** is stored as columns and rows. 
> \
> You can read-in stand-alone tables, or geocode addresses and lat/long coordinates. 
> \
> The most common formats you'll work with are .txt and .csv
