title: Data Types and Formats
---
  
## **Data types**
are attributes that specify the type of data an object can hold.
<br>

> GIS uses three main data types:<br>
> **1) Vector**
> 
> **2) Raster**
> 
> **3) Tabular**

<br>
  <br>

### **Data formats**
are specific or preferred file extensions for sharing, re-use, and preserving data.
<br>

> Vector data includes formats like **shapefiles** (.shp). <br>
> Shapefiles are GIS-specific data formats used in both proprietary and open-source software. <br>
> They come in three types of geometries - points, lines, and polygons. <br>
> 
> <br>
> 
> Raster data stores information in a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value. <br>
> Examples include **GeoTIFF, TIFF, JPG or DEM**

<br>

> Tabular data is stored as columns and rows. 
>
> You can read-in stand-alone tables, or geocode addresses and lat/long coordinates. 
>
> The most common formats you'll work with are **.txt and .csv**
