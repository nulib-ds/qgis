title: Data Types and Formats
---
  
### **Data types**
are attributes that specify the type of data an object can hold.

> GIS uses three main data types:
>
> **1) Vector**
>
> **2) Raster**
>
> **3) Tabular**

<br>
  <br>
    <br>

### **Data formats**
are specific or preferred file extensions for sharing, re-use, and preserving data.

> **Vector data** includes formats like *shapefiles*. Shapefiles are GIS-specific data formats used in both proprietary and open-source software.

> **Raster data** stores information in a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value.

> **Tabular data** is stored as columns and rows. 
> 
> You can read-in stand-alone tables, or geocode addresses and lat/long coordinates. 
> 
> The most common formats you'll work with are .txt and .csv

For today's workshop, we'll only be using vector data, as raster data tends to be larger and slower to work with.
